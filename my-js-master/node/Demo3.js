1. What is Synchronus programming?
Synchronus programming is a programming model where the program is executed line by line. It means that the program is executed one line at a time and the next line is executed only after the current line is executed. This is the default behavior of JavaScript.

Simplest Defination
In Asynchronus Programm, easch task is performed one after the other, and the program waits for each operation to complete before moving on to the next one. This is also known as blocking or sequential programming.

2. What is Asynchronus programming?
Asynchronus programming is a programming model where the program is executed concurrently. It means that the program can perform multiple tasks at the same time. This is achieved by using callbacks, promises, and async/await.

3. What is Multi Threaded Programming in JS?
Multi-threaded programming is a programming model where the program is executed concurrently by multiple threads. Each thread is a separate flow of control that can execute independently of the others. This is achieved by using Web Workers in JavaScript.
